Social-Genie – Social Media Manager

Social-Genie is a secure web app that lets you manage multiple social accounts in one place. Built with Node.js, Express, and Supabase, it allows you to sign in using Google, link your X (Twitter) and Instagram accounts, and post directly with ease. You can create AI-generated images and captions using OpenAI, store them safely on AWS S3, and preview posts before publishing.

Key features include Google OAuth authentication, real-time post updates, tweet analytics, and responsive design for mobile and desktop. Security is handled through CSRF protection, rate limiting, and Supabase’s row-level security.

The app simplifies content creation by combining manual posting with AI-powered tools. With a unified dashboard, you can view analytics, manage accounts, and streamline your social media workflow—all from one platform. Social-Genie offers a modern, privacy-focused solution for individuals and creators to enhance their online presence effortlessly.
